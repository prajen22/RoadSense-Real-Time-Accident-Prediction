# README: Synthetic Driving Dataset for Accident Detection and Driver Behavior Classification

## Overview

This repository contains the script and methodology for generating a synthetic driving dataset used for machine learning tasks such as accident detection and driver behavior classification. The dataset consists of various vehicle parameters, including speed, RPM, throttle, g-force, acceleration, brake pressure, and steering angle. These parameters are associated with labeled accident severity and driver behavior classes.

The dataset is designed to be used for training and testing machine learning models aimed at detecting accidents and classifying driver behavior based on driving conditions. The labels for accident severity (No Accident, Minor Accident, and Major Accident) and driver behavior (Normal, Aggressive, and Careless) are generated through a set of predefined conditions.

## Dataset Parameters

The dataset includes the following parameters that represent key driving characteristics:

1. **Speed** (km/h): Vehicle speed. Higher speeds are associated with an increased likelihood of accidents.
2. **RPM** (revolutions per minute): Engine RPM, indicating engine load and vehicle performance.
3. **Throttle** (0 to 1): Throttle position, with higher values indicating more aggressive acceleration.
4. **G-Force** (g): Gravitational force acting on the vehicle, indicating acceleration or deceleration.
5. **Acceleration** (m/s²): Vehicle's acceleration or deceleration. Abrupt changes in acceleration may indicate risky behavior.
6. **Brake Pressure** (0 to 1): Pressure applied to the brake, used to indicate emergency braking or hard braking.
7. **Steering Angle** (degrees): Angle of the steering wheel, used to assess sharp turns or erratic driving behavior.

### Labeling Criteria

#### Accident Severity Labels:
The accident severity label is determined by a combination of speed, g-force, brake pressure, and acceleration values. The severity is classified into three categories:

- **0: No Accident** - Normal driving behavior without severe maneuvers.
- **1: Minor Accident** - Moderate likelihood of an accident based on speed, braking, or g-force.
- **2: Major Accident** - High speed, high g-force, and hard braking suggesting a severe accident.

**Accident Severity Logic**:
- **Major Accident (Severity 2)**: High speed (> 90 km/h), high g-force (> 4), and hard braking (brake pressure > 0.7).
- **Minor Accident (Severity 1)**: Moderate speed (50 - 90 km/h), moderate g-force (> 2), or moderate braking (brake pressure > 0.5).
- **No Accident (Severity 0)**: Speed within normal limits (<= 80 km/h), low g-force, and low brake pressure.

#### Driver Behavior Labels:
The driver behavior label is based on driving characteristics such as speed, acceleration, throttle, and steering angle. The behavior is classified into three categories:

- **0: Normal Driver** - Safe driving practices with moderate speed and smooth acceleration.
- **1: Aggressive Driver** - High speed, rapid acceleration, and sharp turns.
- **2: Careless Driver** - Excessive speed, erratic braking, and low throttle.

**Driver Behavior Logic**:
- **Aggressive Driver (Behavior 1)**: High speed (> 90 km/h), high acceleration (> 3 m/s²), high throttle (> 0.8), sharp steering (> 30 degrees).
- **Careless Driver (Behavior 2)**: Speeding (> 80 km/h), high brake pressure (> 0.7), low throttle (< 0.2).
- **Normal Driver (Behavior 0)**: Moderate speed, smooth acceleration, appropriate throttle usage.

## Why These Parameters?

- **Speed**: A critical factor in accident severity. High speeds increase the likelihood of major accidents.
- **RPM**: Provides insights into engine performance and driving intensity.
- **Throttle**: Indicates the level of acceleration, where higher values often correspond to aggressive driving.
- **G-Force**: Measures the intensity of acceleration and deceleration. High g-force values suggest rapid acceleration, hard braking, or sharp turns.
- **Acceleration**: Abrupt acceleration or deceleration can signal risky or aggressive driving behavior.
- **Brake Pressure**: High brake pressure suggests emergency stops or aggressive braking.
- **Steering Angle**: Sharp turns at high speeds can indicate reckless or aggressive driving behavior.

## Synthetic Data Generation Logic

The synthetic dataset is generated by randomly creating values for the vehicle parameters and applying predefined logical rules to classify accident severity and driver behavior. This approach ensures that the generated data mimics real-world driving scenarios, making it suitable for training and evaluating machine learning models.

### Data Generation Flow:
1. Generate random values for each vehicle parameter (speed, RPM, throttle, etc.) within specified ranges.
2. Apply the `label_accident` function to assign an accident severity label based on the generated values.
3. Apply the `label_driver_behavior` function to assign a driver behavior label based on the generated values.
4. Store the dataset, including both the parameters and the labels, in a CSV file for model training.

## Example CSV Structure

The generated dataset is stored in a CSV file with the following structure:

| speed | rpm  | throttle | g_force | acceleration | brake_pressure | steering_angle | accident_severity | driver_behavior |
|-------|------|----------|---------|--------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 85.7  | 3000 | 0.6      | 3.2     | 1.8          | 0.4            | 15.2           | 0                 | 0               |
| 110.3 | 3500 | 0.9      | 5.1     | 4.5          | 0.8            | -20.0          | 2                 | 1               |
| 70.1  | 2500 | 0.2      | 1.0     | -0.5         | 0.3            | 5.0            | 0                 | 0               |

## Conclusion

The synthetic driving dataset generated in this project serves as a valuable resource for training machine learning models in accident detection and driver behavior classification. By simulating driving conditions, we can train and test models without the need for real-world sensor data, providing a cost-effective approach to building intelligent driving systems.
